# Recommender Systems with Python


Recommender Systems are one of the most popular and widely used application of data science. In this project, I build a `Recommender System with Python`. I discuss various types - `Content-based filtering recommender system` and `Collaborative filtering recommender system`. Also, I discuss various ways to improve the `Recommender Systems`. I discuss `matrix factorization`.

## 1. Introduction to Recommender Systems

-	Recommender systems are one of the most popular data science applications today.
-	A recommender system is a data science application that is used to predict or offer products to customers based on their past purchase or browsing history.
-	At the core, a recommender system employs a machine learning algorithm whose job is to predict user's ratings for a particular entity.
-	It is based on the similarity based on the entities or users that previously rated those entities.
-	The idea is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities.
-	Recommender systems have wide variety of applications.
-	Many of the big technology companies use a recommender system in some form to recommend products to customers.
-	They are used by Amazon for product recommendations, YouTube for video recommendations, Netflix and IMDB for movie recommendations and Facebook for friend recommendations.
-	The ability to recommend relevant products or services to users can be very profitable for a company.  Hence, it is so common to find this application by many companies.
