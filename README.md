# Recommender Systems with Python


Recommender Systems are one of the most popular and widely used application of data science. In this project, I build a `Recommender System with Python`. I discuss various types - `Content-based filtering recommender system` and `Collaborative filtering recommender system`. Also, I discuss various ways to improve the `Recommender Systems`. I discuss `matrix factorization`.
